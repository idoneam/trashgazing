### TODO:
#### Backend:
(Python)
[x] sgp4 1.4 to analyze orbits, positions/velocities
[] space-track.org's API to get data, easy to parse based on object-type (DEBRIS)
[] can also extract metadata (mission, country of origin, year) for annotation purposes
[] Filter the original list of debris to get the nearby debris only (use python's `filter()` or `map()`)

#### Frontend:
(Javascript, WebGL)
[] WebGL for rendering (doing 3D->2D projection)
[] display as a circle oriented on compass directions
[] dynamic: update every second to illustrate updated positon maybe?
[] background: space lol
[] ability to click on each one to generate metadata table
[] annotation option ; bring up captions for each object containing name (maybe also year)
