### TODO:
#### Backend:
(Python)
- can also extract metadata (mission, country of origin, year) for annotation purposes
- translate GPS of current location to position (XYZ)
- filter it for points that fall into the same octant
- filter based on closer ones

#### Frontend:
(Javascript, WebGL)
- WebGL for rendering (doing 3D->2D projection)
- display as a circle oriented on compass directions
- dynamic: update every second to illustrate updated positon maybe?
- background: space lol
- ability to click on each one to generate metadata table
- annotation option ; bring up captions for each object containing name (maybe also year)
